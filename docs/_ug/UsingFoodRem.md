### Command Format

You will encounter FoodRem commands throughout this User Guide. Before you delve into the different commands in [Commands](#commands), letâ€™s learn what a command consists of.

Here is an example:

![CommandExample](images/CommandExample.png)

A command consists of:

1. Command Word to tell FoodRem what action you wish to execute. These actions are covered in [Commands](#commands)
1. [Flags](#flags) to distinguish parameters
1. [Placeholders](#placeholders) that you can replace with your parameter inputs

### Flags

Flags are delimiters that enable FoodRem to distinguish different parameters without ambiguity.

| Flags | Related Placeholder   |
|-------|-----------------------|
| n/    | ITEM_NAME<br>TAG_NAME |
| qty/  | QUANTITY              |
| u/    | UNIT                  |
| buy/  | BOUGHT_DATE           |

| p/    | PRICE                 |
| r/    | REMARKS               |

### Placeholders

Placeholders are words in uppercase to show you what type of parameters you can supply to a command.
