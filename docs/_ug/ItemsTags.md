### Item

An item is a food item that you would like to include in FoodRem.
The following are all the attributes store for each item:

* Item name
* Item quantity
* Item unit (Unit of measurement e.g. `kg`, `packets`)
* Item bought date
* Item expiry date
* Item price
* Item remark

Restrictions for all attributes can be found in [Placeholders](#placeholders).

### Tag

A tag serves as a means to categorise items. These tags are also unique and case-sensitive.

We can tag multiple items with the same tag and each item can have multiple tags. Tags are optional
and serve as a means to easily categorise items.

Tags can be renamed and these changes would be reflected on all items immediately.
