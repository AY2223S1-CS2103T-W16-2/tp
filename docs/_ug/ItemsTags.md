#### Item

An item is a food item that you would like to include in your inventory.
The following are the attributes stored for each item:

* Item name
* Item quantity
* Item unit (Unit of measurement e.g. `kg`, `packets`)
* Item bought date
* Item expiry date
* Item price
* Item remark
* Item tags

FoodRem items are unique by name and case-sensitive. 

This means you cannot add two items on the same name.

Restrictions for all attributes can be found in the [Placeholders](#placeholders) section.

#### Tag

A tag serves as a means to categorise items. These tags are also unique and case-sensitive.

We can tag multiple items with the same tag and each item can have multiple tags. These Tags are optional.

Tags can also be renamed and these changes would be reflected on all items immediately.
