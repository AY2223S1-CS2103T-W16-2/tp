### Project: AddressBook Level 3

AddressBook - Level 3 is a desktop address book application used for teaching Software Engineering principles. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

**Refactoring**:

* **Refactored Feature**: Refactored `tag` model ([PR#140](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W16-2/tp/pull/140))
  * What it does: encapsulates the idea of `tag` so that users can create and add `tag` to `item`.
  * Justification: This feature allows `item` to be classified into different categories. The refactoring allows for creating of any tags as well as updating of the restrictions we would like to place on names for `tag`.
  * Highlights: This refactoring allows users to create any `tag` they want. Through the use of regex, it also updates the restrictions we would like to place on names for `tag`, such as character limit or disallowed characters.

* **Refactored Feature**: Added storage for `tag` model ([PR#223](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W16-2/tp/pull/223))
  * What it does: Adds storage functionality for the refactored `tag` model.
  * Justification: This feature is needed as we needed to store a separate list for `tag` besides the `item` list.

**New feature**:

* **New Feature**: Added `renametag` command ([PR#179](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W16-2/tp/pull/179))
  * What it does: Allows for renaming of existing `tag`.
  * Justification: Users might make errors in creating `tag` so we want to allow them to rename `tag`.

* **New Feature**: Added `deletetag` command ([PR#199](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W16-2/tp/pull/199))
  * What it does: Allows for deletion of existing `tag`.
  * Justification: To allow users to delete `tag` no longer used.

* **New Feature**: Added `filtertag` command ([PR#302](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W16-2/tp/pull/302), [PR#353](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W16-2/tp/pull/353))
  * What it does: Allows for filtering for `item` by `tag`.
  * Justification: This feature is the core functionality added by `tag`. We can classify `item` by `tag` so naturally we would like to filter by `tag`.
  * Credits: Thanks to `eugenetanwl3881` for catching a bug with the Ui related to `filtertag`.
