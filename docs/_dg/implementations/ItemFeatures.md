#### Sorting an Item

##### Overview

<!-- TODO: ACTIVITY DIAGRAM -->

The `sort` feature sorts the list of items currently displayed to the user by specified flag(s). It is possible to sort by one or more criteria. A list of available criteria for sorting includes:

* Name
* Quantity
* Unit
* Bought Date
* Expiry Date

Currently, sorting is performed ascendingly. A future implementation will allow sorting either ascendingly or descendingly.

##### Feature Details

1. The user can perform other commands that modifies the presented item list, such as the `find` command.
1. The user specifies one or more criteria used for sorting. Available criteria for sorting are listed above.
1. If the displayed item list is empty, then an empty list is displayed.
1. If the item list is not empty, the items are sorted according to the specified criteria. Sorting is performed in order of the criteria specified.

##### Feature Considerations

There is a `SortedList` obtained from an immutable item list. When the `SortCommand` is executed to sort the list of items, one or more comparators are chosen depending on the provided sorting criteria. the comparators are combined into one comparator. The `SortedList` are sorted in the specified order of the Comparators. The UI tracks changes to the `SortedList` and displays the updated sorted item list.

Notably, the `SortedList` wraps around a `FilteredList`, which wraps around an immutable `ObservableList`.
