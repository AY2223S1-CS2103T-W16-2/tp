This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

{% include_relative _dg/TaggingFunctionality.md %}

#### Tagging an item

The `tag` feature tags an item with with the provided tag name in FoodRem. If both the item and the tag are valid, the item will be tagged successfully.

#### How the `tag` command works

1. The user specifies a tag name and the item index (which corresponds to the index of the item displayed on the item list on FoodRem UI).
1. If the tag name or index is not provided, the user will be prompted to enter them correctly via an error message.
1. The tag name is cross-referenced with the current tags in the database and an error is thrown if the tag does not exist in the database.
1. The index is cross-referenced to the list of item displayed and an error would be thrown if the index is out of range of the list. This informs the user that the item does not exist.
1. If the item index and tag name are both valid, the item is checked to determine whether that item contains the specified tag. If the specified tag is already contained in the item, an error would be thrown to inform user about the duplicate tag.
1. If Step 5 completes without any exceptions, a new copy of the item is created and the tag would be added to that item. This new copy of item would replace the original item in the database.

#### Why it is implemented this way

When the `TagCommand` is executed to tag a tag to an item, a copy of the item is created and the tag is added to it before replacing this new copy of the item with the original item in the list of items in FoodRem. We chose to replace the original item with the new item because this will allow the UI to detect a change in the `UniqueItemList` and thus update and show the item with their new tag included.

### Sorting Items

#### Implementation

The `sort` feature sorts the list of items currently displayed to the user by specified flag(s). It is possible to sort by one or more criteria. A list of available criteria for sorting includes:

* Name
* Quantity
* Type
* Quantity
* Bought Date
* Expiry Date

Currently, sorting is performed ascendingly. A future implementation will allow sorting either ascendingly or descendingly.

#### How the `sort` command works

1. The user can perform other commands that modifies the presented item list, such as the `find` command.
1. The user specifies one or more criteria used for sorting. Available criteria for sorting are listed above.
1. If the displayed item list is empty, then an empty list is displayed.
1. If the item list is not empty, the items are sorted according to the specified criteria. Sorting is performed in order of the criteria specified.

#### Why is it implemented this way

There is a `SortedList` obtained from an immutable item list. When the `SortCommand` is executed to sort the list of items, one or more comparators are chosen depending on the provided sorting criteria. the comparators are combined into one comparator. The `SortedList` are sorted in the specified order of the Comparators. The UI tracks changes to the `SortedList` and displays the updated sorted item list.

Notably, the `SortedList` wraps around a `FilteredList`, which wraps around an immutable `ObservableList`.
